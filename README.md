# lee-cfg
These are my configuration files. Programs are listed below with issues/improvements I'd like to make to them. 
## .bashrc .profile

## vim
editor and IDE.
vimrc and vundle to manage plugins.
## git
### Problems
- I want all of my config files to be in .config but I am having trouble wrangling all my pieces in the pen.
## lf
TUI file manager written in go. Much faster than ranger, but much more of a work in progress at the moment.
### Problems
- Deleting things is a nightmare.
- Still haven't implemented a copy function.
- Doesn't open filetypes with their correct programs properly yet.
- Honestly its barely a file manager. Thinking about trying nnn or switching back to ranger.
## zathura
great pdf reader
### Problems
- None :*)
## karabiner elements
Powerful keyboard input configurator for MacOS.
### Problems
- MacOS
## tmux
Multiplexer session thingy. I use it to split windows and move between multiple terminals, but only when I don't have access to a tiling window manager. For example when I ssh into a machine or am using MacOS.
### Problems
- I want it to start automatically when I am presented a terminal but it gets messy when I ssh into another machine with tmux. It has been helpful but I don't use it when I'm using a twm.
